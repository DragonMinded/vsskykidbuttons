Contains patches to apply to ROMs for Nintendo Vs. Sky Kid to change
the start button from 3 for a 2P game to using 2 for a 2P game, meaning
the game can be played on systems that only have buttons 1 and 2 wired
up without bodging wires on the board or rewiring the button harness.
It does this specifically by changing the function that checks for 1P/2P
start conditions. There is absolutely zero free space in the PRG ROM so
there was no possibility of writing a bit of extra code to copy the bit
for 2 pressed from the 2P controls to the 1P controls byte. So, instead
I opted for a clever patch to the logic that reads the 1P and 2P start
button presses to preserve the flow while hooking up the 2 button for
2P start.

For more information, see comments in the patch files. This patch is
relatively simple but finding and planning it out was time consuming.
Therefore, there isn't much theory or code to discuss, just the patch
itself.
